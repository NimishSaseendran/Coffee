                    <p class="coffee-banner-para">The discovery of coffee dates back to the 9th century, attributed to
                        an Ethiopian goat herder named
                        Kaldi. According to legend, Kaldi observed his goats dancing energetically after consuming red
                        berries from a particular tree. Curious, he tried the berries himself and felt a similar burst
                        of
                        energy. This serendipitous discovery laid the foundation for the global phenomenon we now know
                        as
                        coffee.

                    <h3>Coffee</h3>
                    <p class="large">Coffee, a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions around the globe, is derived from
                        the roasted
                        seeds of
                        the Coffea plant, known as coffee beans. These beans are the core of a complex and rich industry
                        that spans continents, cultures, and centuries. Coffee's origins trace back to the ancient
                        coffee
                        forests of Ethiopia, where legend suggests that goat herders first noticed the energizing
                        effects of
                        coffee beans. From these humble beginnings, coffee cultivation and trade spread to the Arabian
                        Peninsula, where it became deeply embedded in the culture and daily life.There are two main
                        species
                        of coffee plants cultivated for consumption: Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, commonly known
                        as
                        Arabica and Robusta, respectively. Arabica beans, which account for about 60-70% of the world's
                        coffee production, are prized for their sweet, soft taste and intricate flavor profiles that can
                        include notes of fruit, sugar, and berries. The journey from coffee bean to cup involves several
                        intricate steps, each contributing to the final flavor and quality of the beverage. Once
                        harvested,
                        coffee beans undergo processing to remove the outer fruit layers.

                <div class="col col-1">
                    <p>Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage that originates from Italy. It is made by forcing a
                        small amount of nearly boiling water under high pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. The
                        result is a small, potent shot of coffee that forms the base for many other coffee drinks.
                        Espresso is characterized by its rich, robust flavor and a layer of crema, a creamy, golden foam
                        that sits on top of the liquid. This crema is a hallmark of a well-made espresso, signifying the
                        quality of the coffee and the skill of the barista. Unlike drip coffee, espresso is meant to be
                        enjoyed quickly, often consumed in a few sips. Despite its small size, a single shot of espresso
                        contains about as much caffeine as a regular cup of coffee, making it a powerful and
                        invigorating choice. The versatility of espresso lies in its ability to be enjoyed on its own or
                        as a base for a variety of other beverages, including lattes, cappuccinos, and Americanos.
                    </p>

                    <img src="./coffee/type2.png" alt="">
                    <p>Cappuccino is a traditional Italian coffee drink that is rich and flavorful, known for its
                        balanced combination of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. Typically, a cappuccino is made
                        with equal parts of these three ingredients, resulting in a strong coffee flavor complemented by
                        a creamy texture and a frothy top. The key to a perfect cappuccino lies in the texture and
                        temperature of the milk, which should be steamed to create a dense, velvety foam. This foam not
                        only enhances the drink's texture but also acts as an insulating layer, keeping the coffee warm.
                        Cappuccinos are often enjoyed in the morning in Italy, paired with a pastry like a croissant.
                        Outside of Italy, they are popular throughout the day. The drink can be customized with a
                        sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top, adding an extra layer of flavor. Cappuccinos offer
                        a more intense coffee experience than lattes due to the higher proportion of espresso</p>

                <div class="col col-3">
                    <p>Mocha also known as a caff√® mocha, is a delightful fusion of coffee and chocolate, combining the
                        rich flavors of espresso, steamed milk, and chocolate syrup or cocoa powder. Originating from
                        Italy, the mocha is inspired by the flavors of the Yemeni city of Mocha, which was historically
                        a significant coffee trade center. A typical mocha consists of one or two shots of espresso,
                        mixed with hot chocolate or chocolate syrup, and topped with steamed milk and often a dollop of
                        whipped cream. The result is a sweet, indulgent beverage that appeals to coffee and chocolate
                        lovers alike. The chocolate adds a creamy sweetness that balances the bitterness of the
                        espresso, creating a harmonious blend of flavors. Some variations include adding flavored
                        syrups, such as vanilla or peppermint, to enhance the drink further.</p>

                    <p>Irish coffee is a delightful cocktail that combines hot coffee, Irish whiskey, sugar, and a layer
                        of cream. Originating in Ireland in the 1940s, this drink is designed to be both invigorating
                        and warming, making it a popular choice in colder climates. To prepare an Irish coffee, a strong
                        brewed coffee is mixed with a shot of Irish whiskey and a teaspoon of brown sugar, which helps
                        balance the bitterness of the coffee and the bite of the whiskey. The mixture is then topped
                        with lightly whipped cream, creating a contrasting layer of cold, creamy richness. The key to a
                        perfect Irish coffee is to avoid stirring the cream into the drink, allowing it to float on top,
                        so each sip passes through the cream before reaching the coffee and whiskey blend. This layering
                        effect provides a unique taste experience, blending the warmth and strength of the coffee and
                        whiskey with the smooth, cooling sensation of the cream. </p>

                <div class="col col-5">
                    <p>Macchiato meaning "stained" or "spotted" in Italian, is a coffee drink that traditionally
                        consists of a shot of espresso "stained" with a small amount of steamed milk or milk foam. This
                        drink is designed to provide the bold, intense flavor of espresso with a slight mellowing effect
                        from the milk, making it stronger than a latte but milder than a straight espresso. There are
                        two main variations of the macchiato: the espresso macchiato and the latte macchiato. The
                        espresso macchiato features a dollop of milk foam on top of the espresso, while the latte
                        macchiato involves pouring the espresso into steamed milk, creating a layered effect. The
                        macchiato's versatility allows for numerous adaptations, including flavored versions like
                        caramel or vanilla macchiatos, popularized by coffee chains. This drink is ideal for those who
                        enjoy the robust taste of espresso but prefer a touch of creaminess to balance the intensity

                    <img src="./coffee/type6.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>Cold brew is a refreshing and smooth coffee beverage made by steeping coarsely ground coffee
                        beans in cold water for an extended period, usually 12 to 24 hours. Unlike traditional hot
                        coffee, cold brew is never exposed to heat, which results in a lower acidity and a naturally
                        sweeter flavor profile. After steeping, the coffee grounds are filtered out, leaving behind a
                        concentrated coffee that can be diluted with water or milk to taste. This process yields a
                        coffee that is less bitter and has a rich, robust flavor, making it a popular choice for those
                        who prefer a milder, smoother coffee experience. Cold brew is typically served over ice and can
                        be customized with various additions, such as flavored syrups, cream, or a splash of tonic water
                        for a unique twist. Its convenience and long shelf life.</p>

                    <p>Affogato is a delightful Italian dessert that elegantly combines the worlds of coffee and ice
                        cream. The term "affogato" translates to "drowned" in Italian, which perfectly describes this
                        treat: a scoop of vanilla gelato or ice cream is "drowned" in a shot of hot espresso. The
                        contrast between the hot, bitter espresso and the cold, sweet ice cream creates a harmonious
                        balance of flavors and temperatures, making it a popular choice for those looking for a simple
                        yet indulgent dessert. To prepare an affogato, a single or double shot of freshly brewed
                        espresso is poured over a generous scoop of vanilla gelato or ice cream. Some variations may
                        include a splash of liqueur, such as amaretto or Frangelico, for an added layer of complexity.
                        The espresso melts the ice cream slightly, resulting in a creamy, coffee-infused dessert that
                        can be enjoyed with a spoon or sipped directly from the cup. </p>
